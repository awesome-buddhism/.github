> Documenting Buddhist technology, data and AI - A curated collection documenting tools, data, and AI resources for Buddhist studies, practice, and communities, organized by the Buddhist Knowledge Supply Chain framework.

## 🙏 Mission

Just as grain transforms into bread through a structured process that nourishes communities, this project documents how ancient Buddhist wisdom transforms into accessible digital knowledge through a comprehensive technology supply chain. Our goal is to document the Buddhist technology landscape, enabling collaboration, reducing duplication, and optimizing projects by improving communication and making information about existing technologies transparent.

**Important**: This is a documentation project. We document existing technologies, data, and AI systems - we do not build or implement new tools. Our focus is on creating comprehensive, well-organized information about the Buddhist tech ecosystem.
